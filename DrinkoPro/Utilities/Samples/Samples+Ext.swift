He then perfected his own recipe for the cocktail, including his signature flamed orange zest twist as a garnish, while working at the Rainbow Rooms in Manhattan.\n\nDeGroff has never claimed to have invented the Cosmopolitan. In his 2002 book \"The Craft of Cocktail\", he explains that he popularized a definitive recipe that became widely accepted as the standard.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan gained immense popularity after it was frequently shown on the television show \"Sex and the City\", with the characters often sipping Cosmos and wondering why they ever stopped drinking them. The show's influence helped the cocktail become a household name.")

The two most commonly found shakers are the 'Cobbler shaker,' which has three pieces, and the 'Boston shaker,' which has two pieces. I highly recommend the 'Boston shaker' because it's easy to use with one hand, making it look and sound good. Not only is it the most popular choice for professional bartenders because it's more effective with straining, but it's also easier to find spare parts for it due to its quality."),

The fine strainer (or tea strainer) catches all the small shards that come through. My preferred strainer is called the 'Calabrese Hawthorn strainer,' which is versatile and mainly used in combination with the fine strainer."),
