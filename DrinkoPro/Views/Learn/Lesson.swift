Said so, let me help you out picking the right tools to start making awesome cocktails.\n\nâ€¢ COCKTAIL SHAKERS\nThe two things to consider when buying a cocktail shaker are the style and the material.\nThere are two main style of shakers, a three-piece shaker, called Cobbler shaker, and a two-piece called Boston. The Cobbler is very hard to find a very well made one and is even hard to find spare parts, it tends to leak and it doesn't strain as quickly as a two-piece set up.\nMy suggestion is to go with a two-piece shaker with both parts made with metal, stainless steel is fine to start with too, simply because it is the most popular choice for professional bartenders, I use it at home and at work, is easier to use one-handed and looks and sounds good while shaking.",
