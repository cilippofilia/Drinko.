                "body": "I want to emphasize that you do not need all the essential equipment immediately. However, I can assist you by selecting the right tools to start making extraordinary cocktails.\n\nCOCKTAIL SHAKERS:\nWhen purchasing a shaker, there are two main factors to consider: the style and the material it's made of (metal, stainless steel, plastic, etc.). The two most commonly found shakers are the 'Cobbler shaker,' which has three pieces, and the 'Boston shaker,' which has two pieces. I highly recommend the 'Boston shaker' because it's easy to use with one hand, making it look and sound good. Not only is it the most popular choice for professional bartenders because it's more effective with straining, but it's also easier to find spare parts for it due to its quality.\n\nSTRAINERS:\nThere are three different types of strainers: 'Julep,' 'Hawthorn,' which prevents the chunks of ice from falling into the cocktail glass, and the fine strainer. The fine strainer (or tea strainer) catches all the small shards that come through. My preferred strainer is called the 'Calabrese Hawthorn strainer,' which is versatile and mainly used in combination with the fine strainer.\n\nJIGGER:\nThe jigger set I like to use consists of two vessels, each a double cone. The smaller one usually measures 25 ml and has marks on the inside for 15 ml, and the larger one measures 50 ml and has a mark for 35 ml.\n\nBAR SPOON:\nBar spoons are useful for mixing and layering mixed drinks, which works best when the stirring technique is very smooth. They can also measure small amounts of liquids, usually around 5 ml, and fish cherries or olives out of the jar.\n\nOTHER TOOLS:\nMuddler: Get a good one to smash fruits at the bottom of a glass, or alternatively, you can use the flat surface at the top of the bar spoon if it has one.\nPeeler: If you don't already have one at home, get a good 'Y' peeler and avoid flexible and thin materials. I have destroyed one while peeling a firm lemon, and it sliced my finger badly.\nKnives and cutting board: You can pretty much use any good sharp knife, and any kind of chopping board will do the job.\nJuicer: If you don't already have one at home, I would recommend buying a 'Mexican elbow' for lemons, which you can also use to squeeze limes.\nMixing glass: They are quite expensive and not essential. You can easily use one of the two tins of the cocktail shaker and avoid a big expense.",

                "description": "Learn why you should shake cocktails and much, much more!",
                "body": "Shaking a cocktail is one of the quickest ways to chill it. The liquid is rapidly distributed throughout the shaker and ice, which speeds up thermal exchange between the two. In this article, I will explain why the faster you shake, the faster the cocktail chills.\n\nGenerally, a cocktail should be shaken for about 8 to 10 seconds. Shaking it for longer will have little impact on the final result, and it will waste energy. A vigorous shake will create a layer of ice around the shaker. Once you achieve this layer, you can stop shaking, indicating that the liquid inside has reached the coldest possible point, around -5° C. The shaking technique and ice shape are not that important, but you should never shake with crushed ice.\n\nShaking also adds aeration to cocktails. The ice traps small bubbles of air inside the liquid, which affects the tactile experience of the cocktail and the way the flavors are perceived. However, keep in mind that shaking will make the drink cloudy, regardless of how clear the ingredients are.\n\nAfter shaking a cocktail, you should always double strain it to remove the ice shards and any floating bits of fruits, seeds, or pulp. This will make the drink smoother.\n\nWhen making a cocktail, pour all the ingredients into the small tin of the shaker and then fill it with ice. Put the big tin on top, turn it upside-down, and twist both tins in opposite directions. Generally, the small tin can hold up to two cocktails, depending on the amount of liquid per cocktail. After shaking, you can hit the shaker on the side an inch below the rim to break the seal. This takes practice, so don’t worry if it doesn’t work the first time.\n\nHere are some pro tips to keep in mind: put the cheapest ingredients in first to minimize wastage, and if you need to make an uneven number of cocktails, you can evenly split the extra one between the two shaker sets and then pour evenly into the glasses.\n\nFinally, remember that cocktails served without ice have a short life span. You can either drink them quickly or chill the glass before using it.\n\nTo recap, shake the cocktail vigorously for 8-10 seconds with ice cubes, and shaking will chill, dilute, and aerate the drink.",

                "description": "Why do you stir certain cocktails instead of shaking them?",
                "body": "The reason why we stir cocktails, like Martinis, is because it yields a visually and taste-wise appealing end result. When you stir a cocktail, you have much more control over the dilution of the ice. However, it's important to remember that science says, 'ice will melt with heat, which is taken from the drink'. Therefore, once you reach that frosty effect outside your mixing glass, almost nothing will change, and all your effort will go to waste. A stirred cocktail will keep all your ingredients clear, since there will be no air bubbles trapped inside it. This also means that the flavors of the ingredients will be more prominent. The stirring technique does not impact the outcome of the cocktail, but a good technique will make you look professional. Grab a nice long bar spoon and put it close to the mixing glass, smoothly let it rotate between your fingers, and against the glass in a circular path. When stirred, the temperature of the cocktail will drop around 0°C in under 10 seconds, but it will take you more than 40 seconds to reach the same temperature of a shaken cocktail.\n\nSet up: The most commonly used practice is to pour all the ingredients inside the mixing glass (cheapest ingredients first) and then add ice and stir. Chilling the mixing glass first is a good practice, but not essential.\n\nPro tips:\n- Cocktails served without ice have a short lifespan. You can either drink them fast or chill the glass before serving. This will give you a little more time to enjoy it.\n- A good stir takes twice as long as washing your hands. So, you can practice your muscle memory by singing:\n\t- Happy birthday\n\t- I will survive - just the chorus\n\t- Africa - just the chorus\n\nQuick recap:\n- Stir with a consistent pace for about 60 seconds.\n- Always chill the glass if the cocktail is served without any ice.\n- Stirring will highlight your ingredients - quality is key.\n- Stirred cocktails work best with clear liquids.",

                "body": "Churning is a powerful and easy technique that involves vigorously mixing all the ingredients in a glass with crushed ice to instantly chill the cocktail, provide dilution, and create a cohesive flavor profile. While it's often associated with mojitos, it can be used with any cocktail.\n\nTo set up, simply add all the ingredients to the glass, fill it with crushed ice, and use a bar spoon to powerfully mix the ingredients for 8-10 seconds. Top with more crushed ice, as desired.\n\nPro Tips:\n- Keep your ice fresh and well-crushed\n- Avoid churning fizzy ingredients\n- Use a powerful mixing motion with your bar spoon\n- Ensure that solid ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the glass\n\nAnother technique is 'Build in', which involves pouring all the ingredients directly into a glass over ice. For cocktails with sparkling ingredients, avoid pouring them directly onto the ice to prevent them from floating to the top. If this happens, gently stir the cocktail to incorporate all the ingredients.\n\nTo build a cocktail, add all the ingredients to the glass in order of price, and then add ice.

It involves throwing the liquid from one tin to the other, which chills the cocktail and gives it dilution and texture. The reason why it is the best technique for Bloody Marys is that it gets most of the characteristics of a shaken cocktail without creating a thick, bitter foam on top (shaking tomato juice can create foam, and with all the seasoning in a Bloody Mary, it can become unpleasant).\n\nSet up:\nHold the big tin with ice and liquid inside with one hand and lock the ice at the bottom of the tin with your strainer, using whichever way is most comfortable for you. Pour the liquid from one tin to the other constantly until the liquid reaches the desired dilution (this will be more noticeable with thick juices like tomato juice).\n\nPro Tips:\n- Practice this technique with water first.- Use either a 'Calabrese Hawthorn' or a 'Julep Strainer'.",

Egg white is the best ingredient to use for creating the perfect foam, but there are alternatives available for those who are vegan.\n\nDespite concerns about safety, using egg white in cocktails is generally considered safe because it comes into contact with spirits and citric juice, which help kill bacteria.\n\nThe 'Dry Shake' technique involves vigorously shaking ingredients in a cocktail shaker without ice for around 20-30 seconds. This ensures that the egg white combines well with the other ingredients and results in a thick, frothy foam that adds a velvety texture to the cocktail. After the 'Dry Shake', ice is added, and the mixture is shaken briefly before being fine-strained into the glass.\n\nThe 'Reverse Dry Shake' technique is the same as the 'Dry Shake' but in reverse. First, the ingredients are shaken with ice, then the mixture is fine-strained into the shaker, and finally, the egg white is added and shaken vigorously to create a thick foam.\n\nHere are some pro tips to keep in mind:\n\n- Always crack the egg in a separate tin when using egg whites, just in case the yolk is off or the shell breaks.\n- When using alternatives like aquafaba (chickpea water), use around 25-30 ml.\n- Check the recommended measurements for other alternatives on the bottle, such as Mrs. Better Bitter Miraculous Foamer.\n- There is no 'right' technique, so try both and choose your favorite.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- These techniques require two shakes.\n- Always shake vigorously when using egg white.\n- Always fine-strain the cocktail after shaking it with ice.",

However, you can easily mix your cocktails in the glass with ice and be done with it.\n\nNow, let's explore some alternatives to using a shaker:\n\nSHAKER:\nAn empty jam jar is a very useful substitute for a shaker (who doesn't have one lying around?). Mix your ingredients in the jar, fill it with ice, and shake. Since the jar will be full of ice and there will be little surface for the ice to smash against, you will avoid most of the ice cracking while shaking. There's no need to fine strain it; you can simply open the jar and drink out of it! Other useful items for holding cocktail ingredients include an empty spice jar, a protein shaker, or an empty ice cream container. Get creative and use whatever you think is best!\n\nJIGGER:\nDon't have a jigger on hand? No problem! Since you're not selling your cocktails, you can free pour and choose how much booze you want in your drink. However, an easy alternative to a jigger is an espresso mug or a hard boiled egg holder, or anything else that you know roughly how much liquid it can hold.\n\nWith these alternatives, you can mix up a great cocktail even without all the fancy equipment!",

In most cases, it is produced from molasses, except in the French West Indies and Brazil, where fresh sugarcane juice is used to respectively produce Rhum Agricole and Cachaca.\n\nThe distillation process varies among producers, but generally, multiple column stills will reduce the level of impurities and produce a lighter rum. Using a pot still or a single column still will result in a heavier rum.\n\nThere are five types of rums in the market, and in order to be called so, they must have a minimum of 37.5% ABV.\n\n'Light' rum refers to its color and flavor and is mainly used in refreshing cocktails, such as mojitos and daiquiris because it is light on the palate. This type of rum is bottled straight after being distilled and diluted, for example, Bacardi White. Some brands, like Havana with Havana 3, age it for up to three years to give it a signature color and enhanced freshness.\n\n'Golden' rums are a good compromise between light and dark rums, and they have their own character while remaining light on the palate. Their color comes from aging inside wooden casks that were previously used for cognac or whiskey. Some distillers may add caramel to darken the color.\n\n'Dark' rums have a rich and intense flavor and are often used as a floater on top of cocktails to make them eye-catching. If you use them for cocktails, let them shine through and treat them like a good whiskey or cognac.'Overproof' rums are the secret funky ingredient in most tiki cocktails. They can range from light to dark, and their peculiarity is the percentage of ABV, which has to be above 50%.\n\n'Flavored' or 'spiced' rums are pretty self-explanatory categories. These types of rums are generally sweeter, and they can be easily swapped with any other rum for twists. Have you ever tried a coconut rum mojito?",

When Cortes' soldiers captured Mexico in 1519, they discovered that this juice could be distilled and began producing a pseudo-tequila within a decade of their arrival. Tequila is made in Mexico's Jalisco region, and its name is derived from the city of Tequila, which is known as the birthplace of this spirit.\n\nTo make tequila, the agave plant is diced, steamed, and then squeezed to remove the juice. Natural yeast is added, and fermentation begins. In order to be called tequila, this fermented liquid needs to be distilled two times. Silver tequila can go straight from the still to the bottle, with the addition of water to reduce the strength. Reposado and Anejo tequilas, instead, are aged in oak casks so the wood can soften and mellow the spirit, adding character to it.\n\nHere are some fundamental terms to know:\n- Mixto (Mixed) - contains at least 51% agave, with the rest being made up of industrial spirits;\n- Pura (Pure) - 100% blue agave distillate;\n- Blanco (White/Silver) - a clear tequila aged for a maximum of 60 days;\n- Oro (Gold) - the same as blanco tequila but with the addition of flavoring/coloring, usually caramel.\n- Reposado (Rested) - tequila aged in oak casks between 60 days and 1 year;\n- Anejo (Aged) - tequila aged for a minimum of 1 year and up to 10 years.\n\nMezcal, on the other hand, has been made since the 16th century from the juice extracted from the cooking of the heart of the Maguey Plant, a type of agave plant. The Aztecs used it to make Pulque, a sweet beer-like drink consumed during religious ceremonies. Unlike tequila, to give mezcal its smoky flavor, the plant is roasted. Then it is stone-pressed to extract the pulp, steeped in pure water with the addition of yeast, and left to ferment for several days. The fermented liquid is then distilled and bottled.",

Once harvested, the barley is malted, which means it is soaked in water for 1-2 days and allowed to partially germinate. The barley is then dried in a kiln to stop the germination process and develop flavor. To give Scotch Whisky its characteristic smoky flavor, the barley is dried in a kiln heated by peat fire.\n\n• Scotch Grain & Blended Whisky\nScotch Grain Whisky can be made with wheat, corn, rye or other cereals. It is distilled at least two times using a column still, then aged for at least three years in Scotland and reduced with water to a minimum of 40% ABV. This whiskey is used for blending with malt whiskies to create Scottish Blended Whisky, or simply Scotch.\n\n• Irish Whiskey\nFor this type of whiskey, malted and un-malted grains are used, which are heat-dried. The mixture is then fermented to around 8% ABV, and distilled three times to 85% ABV. It must be aged for a minimum of three years in oak casks in Ireland, and after that period it is blended for at least 2 years before the ABV is reduced to lower the strength and bottled.\n\n• American Whiskey\nThese are produced similarly to other whiskies but have some distinct features and methods. American Whiskies use predominantly corn and rye instead of barley. The recipe of different grains is called “mash bill,” which is pressure cooked with a mixture of water and yeast. At this point, almost 25% of the mash from previous batches can be added, which is referred to as “sour mash” to ensure consistency of character throughout the batches. This “sour mash” is then fermented into beer and distilled at least twice. The whiskey is then aged for several years in new charred American oak barrels, which impart sweetness and light smoky flavors to the whiskey.\n\n• Bourbon Whiskey\nThis kind of whiskey can be made exclusively in the US by law and only if it is made in Kentucky can be called Kentucky Bourbon. The majority of the mash must be corn, and the rest can be a mix of wheat, rye, and barley. During distillation, it cannot go over 80% ABV, and then it gets diluted to 63% ABV before aging for at least two years in brand new oak barrels.",

                "body": "Simple syrup is a mixture of equal parts of water and sugar by weight (1:1), while a rich syrup is made with 2 parts sugar to 1 part water (2:1). To make simple syrup, put sugar in a container and add hot water, stirring until the liquid becomes clear. You can also mix the sugar and water with cold water, but this will take longer to dissolve the sugar. This method works with all types of sugar, including granulated, brown, demerara, golden, muscovado, and turbinado.\n\nOnce your sugar syrup is ready, let it cool down, bottle it, and label it with the name of the sugar used, the ratio used, and the date you made it. Store it in the fridge for more than a month.\n\nMost cocktails call for syrup because granulated sugar doesn't dissolve completely when stirred, shaken, or thrown. For drinks like the old fashioned, mojito, or caipirinha that originally call for granulated sugar, it's up to you whether to use granulated or syrup. However, using granulated sugar will make the sweetness of your cocktail evolve over time, which may not be desirable. By using sugar syrup instead, you'll have more control over the sweetness of the drink and it will be easier to replicate the exact same flavor profile.",

                "body": "Syrups are a key component in cocktail making, and it's essential to get them right to achieve the desired consistency and flavour. However, it's important to be cautious when using dense, thick, or non-runny syrups as they can easily crystallize and create a hard, unpleasant texture. To avoid this, it's recommended to dilute them with water in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio, depending on the desired thickness.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at three types of syrups:\n\nHONEY SYRUP:\nA staple ingredient in many classic and modern cocktails, honey syrup is an excellent choice for pairing with whiskeys. It's best to use hot water, but not boiling, and the most commonly used ratio is 3:1. It can last for over a month, and its shelf life can be extended by storing it in the fridge.\n\nAGAVE SYRUP:\nA versatile syrup that pairs well with tequilas and coffee, agave syrup is best cut with a 2:1 ratio of hot water. After cutting, simply bottle it and store it in the fridge for over a month.\n\nVANILLA SYRUP:\nVanilla syrup is a popular ingredient in cocktails, and it pairs well with coffee and fruity flavours. You can either buy vanilla syrup or make it yourself. To make your own, cut a vanilla pod in half lengthwise and let it infuse with simple syrup or flavoured syrup for as long as you like. Pro tip: you can reuse the same vanilla pod multiple times.\n\nIn summary, syrups play a critical role in cocktail making, and it's essential to choose the right ones and use them correctly to achieve the perfect balance of flavour and consistency.",

                "description": "Let’s talk about how you can make your own fruity syrups.",
                "body": "Let’s start by acknowledging the undeniable truth: homemade syrups are far superior to any commercial brand. When you make it yourself, you are in control of the flavor, and there are no stabilizers, which means the flavors are fresher and more natural. Plus, you can make just the right amount you need and mix and match fruits with herbs and spices to create new and exciting flavor combinations. Adding acidity is another way to elevate your syrup game, and shrubs are a great example of that, but we'll save that for another time.\n\nNow, let's dive into two methods for making fruity syrups that I highly recommend. My personal favorite involves weighting the fruit and adding an equal amount of sugar to a jar. Muddle everything together, cover the jar, and let it sit for 8 to 12 hours. After that time has passed, you'll start to see the sugar dissolving. Weigh the result and add an equal amount of warm water by weight, making sure all the sugar is dissolved. Then, strain it and bottle it up.\n\nThe second method involves blending fruits with water and sugar. Fruits like apples and berries will give you two different flavor profiles depending on whether you use hot or room temperature water. Using room temperature water will yield a fresher flavor, while hot water will give you a richer, stewed fruit flavor, like jam. To make this syrup, simply weigh equal parts of fruit, sugar, and water, blend it all together, strain out the solids with a fine mesh strainer, and bottle it up.\n\nIt's important to note that the shelf life of these syrups is relatively short. If you keep it refrigerated, it will last for a week or two, but adding a splash of vodka can extend the shelf life up to a month. So go ahead and experiment with different fruits, herbs, and spices to make your own delicious homemade syrups. You'll never go back to store-bought again!",

                "body": "GINGER\n\nMaking ginger syrup using the Jeff Morganthaler's method is incredibly simple. All you need to do is blend equal parts of hot water, sugar, and peeled (or unpeeled) ginger. Strain all the solids using a cheesecloth or a nut milk bag. You can also use a cotton t-shirt, but make sure it is non-colored and preferably white. Note that this process may ruin or stain the t-shirt, so use one that you're okay with throwing away. Be sure to disinfect the t-shirt before and after using it.\n\nTRIPLE SYRUP\n\nMaster mixologist Dale DeGroff developed the triple syrup, which is a complex syrup that replaces simple syrup or honey syrup in cocktails. While simple syrup is uninteresting in a sour, honey syrup is too warm and flavorful, and can grab too much attention in a cocktail. The triple syrup combines three syrups, taking your sours to a third dimension of flavor. Mix one part simple syrup (1:1), 1/2 part agave syrup, and 1/4 part honey syrup. Adjust the ratio to your taste and start experimenting. Here's an example recipe to get you started:\n\n400 ml simple syrup\n200 ml agave syrup\n100 ml honey syrup",

                "body": "For the best-tasting pomegranate syrup, making it from scratch is the way to go. Although it requires some preparation, the effort is worth it. Follow these proportions and scale accordingly based on your needs.\n\nTo start, you'll need pomegranate molasses, which is a mixture of 950 ml of organic pomegranate juice, 600 gr of sugar, and 35 ml of lemon juice. Place everything in a pan over medium to low heat, stirring frequently. Once it starts boiling, simmer it for around 45-60 minutes until it becomes thick and starts sticking to the bottom of the pan.\n\nFor the syrup itself, you'll need 950 ml of pomegranate juice and 600 gr of sugar. Place it over low heat and stir constantly without bringing it to a boil until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in 180 ml of molasses and combine thoroughly.\n\nOnce done, bottle and label the syrup, and refrigerate for up to two weeks. However, if you don't use it frequently, there are excellent brands available for purchase. They'll last longer and be the best choice for you.",
