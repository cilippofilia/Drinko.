He tells the story of the day when he was serving two friends, Eastham and Carrie Guild from Tahiti, at his restaurant, \"Trader Vic\", in Oakland, California. After serving the drink to his friends, Carrie took a sip and exclaimed, \"Mai Tai-Roa AÃ©\", which means \"Out of this world - the best\".")
