### Design Patterns

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Separation of business logic and UI
- **Observable Pattern**: Using `@Observable` for reactive state management
- **NavigationStack**: Modern navigation with type-safe routing
- **Dependency Injection**: Environment objects for shared state (Favorites)

### Data Flow

1. **Cocktails Data**: Loaded from JSON files in bundle at runtime
2. **Cabinet Data**: Persisted locally with SwiftData, synced via CloudKit
3. **Favorites**: Stored in UserDefaults with JSON encoding
4. **Settings**: User preferences stored in UserDefaults
